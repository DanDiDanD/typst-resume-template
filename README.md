# 📝 Typst resume template

A clean and modular CV template built with [Typst](https://typst.app/), supporting multi-language content, consistent styling, and PDF export automation.

This template is also designed to be **ATS-friendly** (tested with [JobScan](https://www.jobscan.co/)) — ensuring your exported PDF can be correctly parsed by automated resume screening systems.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [Typst CLI](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) installed globally to export PDF with ``` typst compile main.typ out/file.pdf ```  
- [Tinymist extension for Typst](https://myriad-dreamin.github.io/tinymist/frontend/main.html) (Recommended to preview PDF during writting)
